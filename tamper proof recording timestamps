Creating a tamper-proof timestamp within an app used for filming games is a feasible and effective strategy to ensure the authenticity of the footage. This approach involves embedding a secure and verifiable timestamp into the video as it's recorded. Here's how you can implement such a system:

1. Integrated Time-Stamping in the App
Develop the app to automatically embed a timestamp into the video as it is recorded. This timestamp should be generated by the app itself, not just reliant on the device's system time.
Consider using a server-generated timestamp. When a user starts recording, the app can request the current time from a secure server. This timestamp is then embedded into the video, ensuring that it reflects the actual time of recording, independent of the user's device settings.
2. Use of Secure Timestamps
Implement cryptographic techniques to make the timestamp tamper-proof. For example, you could use digital signatures or hash functions to secure the timestamp.
Each video file can have a unique cryptographic hash that includes the timestamp. Any alteration in the timestamp would change the hash, making tampering evident.
3. Combine with Metadata and Watermarking
Embed the timestamp not only in the video metadata but also as a visible watermark on the video itself. This makes it more challenging to manipulate the timestamp without it being noticeable.
Ensure that the metadata and the visible watermark are consistent and any discrepancy can be a red flag for tampering.
4. Real-Time Sync with a Trusted Source
Sync the app's timing mechanism with a trusted time source, like an atomic clock or an internet time server, to ensure accuracy.
Use secure protocols for this synchronization to prevent interception or manipulation of the time data during transit.
5. Record Additional Data
Alongside the timestamp, record other data like geolocation, device ID, and user ID. This helps in verifying the authenticity of the footage.
6. Secure Storage and Transmission
Ensure that once recorded, the video is stored securely in the app and during transmission to the server.
Use encryption for storing and transmitting the video to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.
7. Implement Regular Audits and Updates
Regularly audit the system for any vulnerabilities and update the app to address any security issues.
Keep the cryptographic components of the app up-to-date to maintain security.
8. User Education and Terms of Use
Educate users about the importance of the integrity of the recordings.
Clearly state in the app's terms of use that tampering with timestamps or videos is prohibited and can lead to penalties.
By integrating these features into your app, you can significantly enhance the reliability of the timestamps and the overall authenticity of the game footage. This approach requires careful planning and possibly consultation with cybersecurity and app development experts to ensure robust implementation.
