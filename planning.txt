Here’s a refined structure that maintains the importance of being a city champion while allowing for top-ranked teams to participate in the national regular season the following year, even if they didn’t make it to the nationals initially.

Tournament Structure
1. City-Level Competition
Regular Season: Teams compete in a self-officiated regular season.
City Playoffs: The top teams from the regular season compete in a knockout format to determine the city champion.
Qualification for Nationals: Only the city champion advances to the national postseason.
2. National Postseason
Single-Elimination Tournament: City champions from various cities compete in a national knockout tournament to determine the national champion.
3. National Regular Season (Next Year)
Automatic Qualifiers: The top teams from the national postseason automatically qualify for the next year’s national regular season.
Ranking-Based Qualifiers: Additional teams qualify based on their ranking, which is determined by their performance during the city-level competition and their city champion's performance in the national postseason.
Ranking System
City-Level Performance: Points are awarded based on regular season and playoff performance within each city.
National Postseason Performance: Additional points for how far the city champion progresses in the national tournament.
Composite Ranking: A combined score that considers both city and national performance to rank teams.
Implementation Example
City of Sydney
City Regular Season:

Sydney Sizzlers finish first, Sydney Sparks finish second.
Sydney Sizzlers win the city playoffs and become city champions.
National Postseason:

Sydney Sizzlers compete in the national postseason.
The Sizzlers reach the semifinals.
Next Year’s National Regular Season:

Automatic Qualification: The Sizzlers, as semifinalists, automatically qualify for the next year’s national regular season.
Ranking-Based Qualification: The Sydney Sparks, with a high composite ranking due to their strong performance in the city-level competition and the Sizzlers' national performance, qualify for the national regular season.
Maintaining Prestige and Competitiveness
City Championship Importance:

Exclusive Title: Only the city champion advances to the national postseason, maintaining the prestige of the city championship.
Trophies and Rewards: Significant rewards for city champions, such as trophies, cash prizes, and media coverage.
Incentives for High Rankings:

National Regular Season Entry: High-ranking teams get to compete in the national regular season even if they didn’t make the national postseason.
Exposure and Development: Teams in the national regular season gain more exposure and experience, helping them improve for future competitions.
Balanced Competition:

Top Teams Competing: Ensuring the national regular season includes the best teams by combining city champions and high-ranking teams.
Dynamic and Fair: The ranking system allows for adjustments based on real performance, ensuring fairness and competitiveness.
Benefits of This Structure
Maintains City Championship Prestige: Ensures that winning the city championship remains a significant achievement.
Encourages Consistent Performance: Teams are motivated to perform well throughout the season to secure a high ranking.
Ensures Competitive Nationals: The national regular season and postseason remain highly competitive with the inclusion of top-ranked teams.
By using this structure, you can ensure that the city championship remains prestigious while providing opportunities for top teams to compete at the national level based on their performance, thus maintaining a high level of competition throughout.
